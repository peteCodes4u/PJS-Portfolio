        <p>Peter J. Smith is an engineer from Boston, MA currently located in Tampa, FL. Peter graduated from the University of Tampa in 2012 with a bachelors of science in chemistry and began his career as a scientist operating as liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) technical professional for Abbott laboratories specifically in the quantitative analytics and rapid diagnostics department for behavioral health and patient monitoring. While operating as a scientist Peter became involved with Abott’s software development team to assist as a quality assurance analyst for the development of a novel laboratory information system (LIS). Peter’s role was critical to providing technical insight that bridged the gap between technical operator, business unit and professional consumer that ultimately resulted in the launch of a cloud based LIS for toxicology rapid diagnostics, after which he assumed the full time role of Senior Quality Assurance Analyst. As the business need increased for complex and fully comprehensive test compendiums for the cloud-based LIS Peter began his journey as an automation engineer.</p>
        <p>Peter developed an algorithm for generating complex end to end functionality tests for automation using VBA and Selenium. Peter successfully developed an ActiveX userform that could utilize his test compendium framework and generate full end to end automation scripts which was shared with the engineering team in order to assist with happy path test case evaluation. It was not long before Peter was offered an opportunity to function professionally as an automation engineer in the cyber security field. Durring his time with the cyber security firm he developed and implemented API test automation frameworks in C#. Peter’s time with that engineering team deeply immersed him in a multitude of topics that he actively leverages to solve everyday business problems and specifically identify problematic code. His experience and interests include working with DBA teams as he has professionally acquired a strong understanding of SQL and noSQL databases, API solutions, C#, Kubernetes, DevOps, JavaScript and more. Peter is passionate about problem solving and using technology to improve efficiency and reduce risk wherever possible. Peter is now currently applying his skills to developing MERN stack applications with a focus on blockchain algorithms, encryption and tokenization. Peter is an excellent analyst that has consistently demonstrated his scientific methods and approaches can assist any team develop new solutions to existing business scenarios or identify the root cause and/or possible solution to issues affecting a multitude of computer languages.</p>
